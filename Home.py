        This research presents a methodology for investigating customers' satisfaction on accomodations based on online Airbnb listings' reviews, using
        **Hugging Face's Zero-shot Classification** (VADER) for sentiment analysis together with **BERTopic** & **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for topic modeling. 
        
        By identifying essential aspects and best practices, the approach aims **To examine the key attributes affecting touristsâ€™ satisfaction and dissatisfaction towards accommodation through the analysis of Airbnb online reviews of Singapore, Thailand, and Turkey**.
